# SECOND LAYER of app structure that I create for the team's (anyteam's) service, so it can use the needed tools while existing on its own.
# The 2nd layer is what is sourced in the 1st layer via "app-of-teams" values.yaml file. 
# The created service (3rd layer) can now use the necessary tools bootstrapped to the 1st layer. 
# chart.yaml - simple desc of what the helm chart is (name, type, version etc). 
# values.yaml - configuration settings for the chart.
